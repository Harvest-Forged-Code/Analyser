"""Presentation views (IO only).

Purpose:
    Provide UI renderers (PySide6 GUI).

Notes:
    The legacy presentation-layer CLI has been removed to optimize the flow.
    For non-GUI processing, use the legacy script under `source/main_be.py`.

Goal:
    Only perform input/output; never contain business logic.
