# Code owners for this repository
#
# NOTE: The previous wildcard rule referenced a non-existent team
# (@Harvest-Forged-Code/owners), which caused CODEOWNERS validation to fail.
# The rule has been commented out to unblock CI. Replace the example below
# with a real GitHub user or team that has write access to this repo.
#
# Examples:
# *   @octo-org/engineering-team
# docs/**  @octocat  (example)

# Repository-wide owner: all changes will request a review from this user
*  @PrabbhukumarSivamoorthy

# *  @Harvest-Forged-Code/owners  <- replace with a valid team or user
